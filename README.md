Just Another Repository

Hi Humans!

Aniruddha here, just starting off putting out a body of work. This might nnot be the most useful piece of literature on the internet, but it is what it is, an MVP, a minimum viable product to set the ball rolling.

Thanks. 
See you later.

Update 1

Turns out code that makes money is kept in private repositories and 
doesn't show up on Public githubs when you exit the companies.
